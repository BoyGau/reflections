1. It's create a new repository, which i can track file and use version control on my files!
2. It's just hold file temporaly so it's different from working directory, and it's can't track files so it's not a
repository. I think stagging area offer us to control which files we should add to create a commit, so we can control 
to add it or not in a many-files case!
3. Use 'git status' after use add to stagging area and use 'git diff' 'git diff --staged' to check content.
4. Branches keep things tidy 'cause when you want to experimental something you dont have to save it on master branch, but still you can still save it.
If only one brach you would have to commit and go back alot since you're experimenting!
5. It help me visualize it as how many branch are there and their position.
