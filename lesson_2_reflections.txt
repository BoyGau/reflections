1. It's create a new repository, which i can track file and use version control on my files!
2. It's just hold file temporaly so it's different from working directory, and it's can't track files so it's not a
repository. I think stagging area offer us to control which files we should add to create a commit, so we can control 
to add it or not in a many-files case!
3. Use 'git status' after use add to stagging area and use 'git diff' 'git diff --staged' to check content.
