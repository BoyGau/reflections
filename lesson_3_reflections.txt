(I didn't write down questions, just answer on reflection 1 and 2, should have done that)
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When i want to push it to GitHub, only if im very sure to push it.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you should see content first before pull, may be of conflitcts
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is when you pull one's repository to your local computer, fork is like clone but it's in GitHub and you have reference to the one's you fork,
branches is just create branches!.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Offline benefits and we can compare two version of remote when go to online state.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- Me and my friend used DropBox several times. It's harder because we are difficult to make experiment of new things, and easier
because its faster to done things, but git still far better.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- When you really thinks your experiments things  its big enough, go on to seperate branch, else just make changes in master directly
since it's time wasting if the change is small.
