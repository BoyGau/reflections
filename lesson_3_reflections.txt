(I didn't write down questions, just answer on reflection 1 and 2, should have done that)
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When i want to push it to GitHub, only if im very sure to push it.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you should see content first before pull, may be of conflitcts
